# Experience-the-Unseen
A desktop app crafted using concepts of OOP , using C# to assist color blinds.
This project presents a comprehensive desktop application designed to assist individuals with color 
blindness, offering a suite of functionalities to improve their interaction with the visual world. The 
application encompasses four main features:
1. Simulator: Utilizing advanced image processing techniques, this feature simulates the visual 
perception of color-blind individuals, allowing users to understand how different types of color 
blindness affect the perception of the environment.
 
2. Corrector: By applying specialized color filters, this tool enhances the ability of color-blind 
users to distinguish between colors more effectively, thereby improving their visual experience 
and aiding in tasks that require color differentiation.
3. Color Detector: This functionality identifies and displays the name of the color at the mouse
pointer's location in real-time, providing immediate feedback and aiding users in identifying 
colors accurately.
4. Tester: Based on the widely recognized Ishihara color test, this feature allows users to 
determine whether they are affected by color blindness or not. By presenting a series of test 
images, it assesses the user's color perception and provides diagnosis.
The integration of these features into a single application aims to offer a valuable toolset for color-blind 
individuals, enhancing their visual comprehension and facilitating better interaction with their 
surroundings. The application leverages cutting-edge image processing and user interface design to 
provide an intuitive and effective solution for the challenges faced by those with color vision deficiencies.
